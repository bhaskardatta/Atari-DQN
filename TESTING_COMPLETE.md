## Key Issues Resolved

### 1. Import and Class Name Fixes
- Fixed DQN network imports (`DuelingDQN` → `DQNNetwork` with dueling=True)
- Fixed environment class names (`DifficultyManager` → `DynamicDifficulty`)
- Fixed config class usage (`ConfigManager` → `Config`)

### 2. Method Signature Corrections
- Updated agent action selection (`explore` → `training` parameter)
- Fixed environment methods (`get_current_parameters` → `_get_current_state`)
- Corrected replay buffer methods (`can_sample` → `is_ready`)

### 3. Configuration Compatibility
- Added field mapping for YAML config files (`beta_start` → `beta`)
- Filtered unsupported configuration fields
- Fixed tuple serialization issues

### 4. Test Logic Updates
- Improved parameter change detection in training tests
- Made statistics tests more robust
- Updated curriculum advancement expectations
